## Self-Reflection

- **How long it took me to finish this?**
It took me about 10 days to complete this.
-

- **What do you think of this completion time?**
I think this is a good amount of time to complete because I implemented multiple games, set up the routing and settings, and added Playwright tests and deployment while I had to balance other courseworks.
- 

- **In hindsight, what would you do differently?**
- The only thing I would do differently is start integrating the Playwright tests and deployment earlier to catch any routing or configuration issues sooner.

- **What resources did you use?**
- I used the course materials and codes from previous assignments. I had to also use online resources for some specific issues I was struggling with.
